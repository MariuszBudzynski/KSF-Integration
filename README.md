Work in Progress This is a live integration with the KSF test environment. Please note that fake data is used exclusively for testing purposes. The description will be updated upon completion.

Note: The KSF test environment allows the use of locally generated certificates. For this Web API, the certificate file testcert.pfx will be used. You can generate it using the KSF-Integration.TestCertificateGenerator console application included in the solution.
