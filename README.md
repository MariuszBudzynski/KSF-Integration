### 🔐 Certificate Information

> The [KSF test environment](https://ksef-test.mf.gov.pl) allows the use of locally generated certificates.

For this Web API, the certificate file `testcert.pfx` will be used.  
You can generate it using the `KSF-Integration.TestCertificateGenerator` console application included in the solution.
